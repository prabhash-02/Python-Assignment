    "- Python dictionaries use a technique called open addressing to resolve collisions, where the colliding key-value pair is stored in a nearby slot.\n",

    "1. Security: Immutable strings prevent unintended changes to sensitive data, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "2. Thread Safety: Immutable strings are thread-safe, meaning multiple threads can access the same string without fear of one thread modifying it and affecting the others.\n",
    "3. Hashing: Immutable strings can be safely used as keys in dictionaries because their hash value remains constant. If strings were mutable, their hash value could change, leading to incorrect dictionary lookups.\n",
    "4. Performance: Immutable strings allow for efficient memory management. When a string is created, Python can allocate a fixed block of memory for it. If strings were mutable, Python would need to dynamically allocate and reallocate memory as the string changes, leading to performance overhead.\n",

    "6. Interning: Python uses a technique called interning to store multiple copies of the same string in memory. This means that if you create multiple strings with the same value, Python will store only one copy of the string in memory, and all variables will reference that same copy. Immutable strings make interning possible.\n",
